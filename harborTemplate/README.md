In this folder, we demonstrate the harbor concept I've been tinkering with for the past 5-6 years. A simple yet strangely elegant 
solution to finding out where things are.

The core idea is splitting things down to the most accessible parts of a computer that a common user will access.
The analogy is to treat each computer/workstation as a harbor or a port. Within, there are many different things being built, maintained,
or simply stopping by for checks. Each "ship" that enters or leaves the harbor is analogous to a file or project. They come in many 
shapes and sizes, but all enter the "ocean" that is our internet.

docks-> The coming and going of all files. This folder represents the dashboard and should serve as the entrypoint and exitpoint for
all files on the given system. 

factory/shipyard-> The land of projects and tooling. From here, all files and applications a user could ever wish to build and create as well
as a place to put tools they have aggregated over the years. This helps to seperate projects we've created and the tools we've downloaded
against the tools installed by default.

office-> The place of book-keeping. Notes, plans, guides, and everything to better compose ourselves rest here. An office is like the
factory except it is disciplined towards any intellectual work.

tavern-> No workplace is complete without a place to relax and chill. Computers may indeed be our tools, but they can also be our 
outlets. All files relating to relaxation and rest reside here.

This has thus covered my 4 basic needs; A place to quickly move files around, a place to build and create projects of various natures,
a place to plan and keep track of information, and a place to relax. The individual nature of each file will explain their individual roles.

Again, this analogy is to help streamline what is important to an end user such as myself. If it serves, change the analogy to one that 
makes sense to you. After all, we do not have to be slaves to others designs.

The docks primary purpose is to quickly work and move files around where they are applicable. The folder should serve as both the desktop,
the file sorter, AND the download location. 

In CS, we recognize that cache is memory that is quickly accessible and workable. Accessing main memory takes time and memory of our own
to remember where we even put things. 

The docks schema is to replicate this cache. We use the desktop as our most frequently accessed and manipulated panel to "dash"
to projects or working items as we chug along as there are many things which we have need of in short time frames.

For example;
-Downloads we get are often things that we are going to immediately use after getting them. 
-We need a new space to work on some project for school or to quickly write up a file.
-We've taken some screenshots or photos that we want to share immediately with our friends. 

These are items that we tangibly will access in short time frames, and as such we should reserve the desktop for such highly volatile
documents. 

We also roll with the concept that there is more than one dock, or dashboard to be used. Often times we have projects we want to open with 
all relevant information to exist right there so we can hit the ground running. The ability to CHANGE DESKTOPS (docks) must be available
upon user request so file work can be done in an efficient and hands on manner. 

Because of this design idea, a dock should have folder shortcuts to places such that each individual file/item can be quickly moved to
appropriate locations without having to remind ourselves what locations they even are.

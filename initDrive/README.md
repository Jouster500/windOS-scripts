Contained within this folder are scripts that are meant to configure a new windows OS to my liking.
This means implementing scheduled tasks, creating applicable folder hierarchies, and installing software such that I can bring my workspace
to any computer.

Expand this idea in the future of mapping additional flash drive configurations for more advanced setups. For example, a music artist may
want to install certain audio software each time they get a new computer, or a computer scientist may want to download the latest 
metric tools.

CORE: No matter the workstation, a persons configurations should be something they always keep for themselves. When a user is done,
all changes must then be reversed.
